# landlab_teaching_tools

This repository will include Jupyter Notebooks that implement Landlab for use in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses.

The notebooks illustrate examples of physical processes implemented numerically.

The notebooks are primarily designed for use as homework assignments or laboratory assignments.

These notebooks are also available to be launched from HydroShare (www.hydroshare.org) with the CUAHSI JupyterHub server.  This enables you and your students to run the notebooks from a web browser with no software installations required.  The following steps were used to publish this curriculum for use on HydroShare.
